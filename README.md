# Air Pollution and Weather Application (AirPoWa)

Earlier the air we breathe in use to be pure and fresh. But, due to increasing industrialization and concentration of poisonous gases in the environment the air is getting more and more toxic day by day. Rapidly increasing human activities like the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation is the major cause of air pollution. Monitoring air quality is crucial for asthma sufferers and people affected by air pollution.
Balkan countries are facing another poorly tackled issue. Skopje, Sofia, Prishtina, and Sarajevo are on the list of Europe’s most polluted cities. Skopje, with nearby Tetovo, holds the unflattering record. In a recent article published on its website, the United Nations Environment Programme named Skopje “Europe’s most polluted capital”. According to the local media, 38% of all deaths in Tetovo and 22% at the state level are the direct result of air pollution.
In this project  a new web application instantly getting PM10 and AQI data from APIs and air quality monitoring, is developed in PHP, Laravel framework. In this application you can see the status of the air pollution in every city in the Republic of Macedonia. By choosing the wanted city, the data about the pollution is provided to the user.
